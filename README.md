# Road Accident Trends & Severity Analysis – United Kingdom  
Excel Analytics Project for Public Safety Improvement

Road accidents remain a major safety concern in the United Kingdom. Speed limits, lighting, surface conditions, and time of day all play a role in how severe an accident becomes. This project structures accident records, analyzes risk drivers, and presents a dashboard for better decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objective

CoreTech Labs assigned a task to convert an unstructured accident dataset into insights that support data-driven safety interventions.

**Main objectives:**
- Clean and standardize the dataset
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis
- Understand accident frequency and severity
- Identify high-risk times, locations, and conditions
- Develop an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers
- Provide insights and actionable recommendations

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Reveals

### 🚑 Accident Impact
- Total accidents: **197,644**
- Casualty distribution: **Slight 86%**, **Serious 13%**, **Fatal 1%**
- Despite a low fatality rate, serious cases remain a public safety challenge

### 📅 When do accidents peak?
- **Friday** shows the highest incident rate
- **3 PM – 5 PM** window drives **77%** of severity risks  
  (end-of-day rush + driver fatigue)

### 🏎️ Speed vs Severity
- Most incidents occur at **30 mph speed limits**
- Higher speed → increased severity likelihood

### 🌦 Surface & Lighting Insights
- **69%** of all accidents occur on **dry** road conditions
- Drivers take more risks when roads seem safe
- Daylight still accounts for most severe cases

### 🗺️ Geographic Hotspots
- Large metropolitan areas like **Birmingham** and **Manchester** show highest concentration
- Highlights where enforcement and infrastructure review matter most

## 🧹 Data Preparation

To ensure analytical reliability:
- Removed duplicates using Accident Index
- Standardized road, lighting, and surface categories
- Split date and time for hourly pattern analysis
- Validated numerical ranges (speed limit & casualty counts)
- Added severity classification and KPI calculations

This created a clean foundation for accurate reporting.

## 🧠 Insights → Actions

| Issue Identified | Recommendation | Expected Outcome |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| High-risk districts | Review infrastructure in Birmingham & Manchester | Reduce recurring hotspot incidents |
| Peak risk time | Increase enforcement **3–5 PM** | Lower severe casualties |
| Speed-related risks | Review speed limits in dense urban areas | Reduce fatal escalation |
| False sense of security on dry roads | Launch **dry-weather safety campaign** | Encourage safer daily driving |
| Lack of continuous monitoring | Adopt dashboard for councils & police | Real-time visibility of changes |

Bottom line: **Driver behavior matters as much as road conditions.**
